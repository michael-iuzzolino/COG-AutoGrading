    "## Part 1 - Battleship\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "The motiviating idea here is that we want to design a core aspect of what could become the game Battleship - the ships. \n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a program utilizing the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, the first question one would ask is, \"what objects can I break the program down into?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, most obvious object for Battleship is the **Ship** object, and that is what we will focus on in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other valid objects would be a **Player** object, **Board** object, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "Think of a class as a blueprint. The blueprint tells you what features and functionality the object created from the blueprint will have. Classes are comprised of **attributes** and **methods**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes** are things such as names, ages, checking account numbers, pin numbers, heights, weights, etc. Attributes should be made **private**. To access or mutate (get or set) these attributes, you will need accessors or mutators (getters or setters) - these are methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** are functions of a class. The methods are used for getting and settng the class's attributes. However, methods can also be used to implement any number of other logical operations that may or may not act upon the class's attributes. They might act on objects from the same (or other) class types. The possibilities are endless, but for now just focus on the methods existing in the **public** domain of the class, and their use is in accessing or mutating the classes private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Just as you may have created 'helper' functions in previous exericses, you can create helper functions with classes - these are usually made **private**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "When you create an object from a class, it is called **instantiation**. The object is what 'exists in the real world' of the program - it exists in your main.cpp function and is involved in the logic flow of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "After instantiating an object, you can then access it's public methods (and attributes, if any are public) by the dot-operator. That is, if you've instantiated a ship object from the battleShip class and it is called `ship1`, then you *call* a class method by `ship1.method_name()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of calling a class method exactly as you do for calling a function in previous assignments. The difference is that the function call has the object + the dot operator prepended to the function call.\n",

    "Create a *PROJECT* in CodeBlocks. If you do not do this, the .cpp files will not link and your program will not work (the linking happens automatically in projects - do not worry about linking anything).\n",

    "The idea is that you have a general idea for what attributes and what functions you want your class to have, so you can write them down without needing to **implement** them - this comes second (and it is the content of the battleShip.cpp file - what you need to do for this exercise).\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we notice that there is a **constructor**: `battleShip(string)`\n",

In the implementation, you need to tie these two together, but more on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, **ignore** the `~battleShip();` function. This is the **deconstructor** and we will have no use for this in this class.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first four functions are simple getters and setters for the ship's name and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, the last two methods in public are `void recordHit()` and `bool isSunk();` - a setter and getter, respectively. All previous methods were involved with initializing the ship - these two methods regulate how this object will behave in the actual game of Battleship. When playing the game, a ship needs to be able to take damage (a hit) and you need to be able to determine if the ship is sunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what it means for a ship to be sunk. Some sort of correlation between the ship's size and its number of hits? This will be made explicit in the implementation.\n",
